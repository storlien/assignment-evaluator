# Assignment Evaluator
Python script utilizing OpenAI's API for evaluation of student submissions for assignments in the course Introduction to Algorithms

Do note that this code is not of high quality. The code suffers from being written in a short amount of time, with many changes done along the way with no reviewing afterwards...

Add your OpenAI API key in a file called API_KEY at the root.

How to run:
```
python3 main.py
```

Submission files and solution files have to have a specific naming and location!
- Submission files should be located under assignment-01/ for the first assignment, and so on.
- Solution files should be located under solutions-01/ for the first assignment, and so on.
